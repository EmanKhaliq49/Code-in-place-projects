# Code in Place 2025 Journey üöÄ

-----

Welcome to my repository for **Code in Place 2025**\! This repo serves as a comprehensive collection of my assignments and the final project completed during Stanford University's incredible Code in Place program.

## About Code in Place

Code in Place is a free, online introductory programming course offered by Stanford University, based on their popular CS106A course. It's designed to make computer science accessible to a global audience, providing a fantastic foundation in programming concepts using Python.

Being part of this program has been an amazing experience, fostering problem-solving skills, persistence, and a deep appreciation for the art of coding.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains all the Python files from my Code in Place 2025 journey:

  * **`Box Row.py`**: An assignment likely involving drawing rows of boxes.
  * **`Double It.py`**: A program possibly designed to double a value or create a duplicate.
  * **`Draw Flag.py`**: An assignment focused on using graphics to draw a flag.
  * **`Fill Karel.py`**: A Karel the Robot program involving filling an area.
  * **`Final Project.py`**: My culminating final project for the course. (Details below\!)
  * **`Jigsaw Karel.py`**: A Karel the Robot program, likely related to assembling a "jigsaw" pattern.
  * **`Khansole Academy.py`**: An implementation of a basic math practice program, similar to Khan Academy.
  * **`Piles by Karel.py`**: A Karel the Robot program, potentially dealing with manipulating piles of beepers.
  * **`Quilt.py`**: An assignment involving creating a quilt pattern using graphics.
  * **`Quizlet.py`**: A program possibly related to creating or using flashcards, similar to Quizlet.
  * **`Stone Mason Karel.py`**: A classic Karel the Robot problem, focusing on filling gaps in a wall.

### My Final Project: Basketball Game üèÄ

My final project, **`Final Project.py`**, is a **simple yet engaging Basketball Game** built using **Python** and the `graphics` library. It's an interactive application where users can control a basketball, shoot hoops, and score points.

**Key features include:**

  * **Dynamic Ball Control:** The basketball follows the mouse cursor, allowing for intuitive aiming.
  * **Goal Detection:** Precise collision detection determines if the ball successfully enters the hoop.
  * **Interactive Feedback:** A "GOALLLLL" message flashes when a point is scored, adding to the game experience.
  * **Game Reset:** The ball automatically repositions after a score, ready for the next shot.

Developing this game allowed me to solidify my understanding of **event handling, object manipulation, conditional logic, and animation**. It was incredibly rewarding to translate a game idea into functional code and see interactive elements come to life in a GUI application.


## Technologies Used

  * **Python 3**
  * **`graphics.py` library** (provided by Stanford University for CS106A/Code in Place)

## How to Run the Projects (Locally)

To run any of these Python scripts locally, you'll need a Python environment set up.

1.  **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EmanKhaliq49/Code-in-place-projects.git
    cd Code-in-place-projects
    ```

2.  **Ensure `graphics.py` is available:** For the projects that use graphics (like `Draw Flag.py`, `Quilt.py`, and `Final Project.py`), the `graphics.py` file must be present in the same directory as the script you are running, or configured in your Python environment. It's typically provided as part of the course materials.

3.  **Run a specific project:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the cloned repository's root directory, and then run the desired file:

    ```bash
    python "Final Project.py"
    # Or for an assignment:
    python "Draw Flag.py"
    ```

    (Note the quotes around filenames with spaces if you're on a command line that requires it.)

## Acknowledgements

A massive thank you to the entire **Code in Place team** at **Stanford University** for creating and delivering such an accessible, high-quality, and impactful programming course. The instructors, section leaders, and community made this a truly exceptional learning journey.

This experience has significantly boosted my confidence and opened my eyes to the vast possibilities that programming offers. I'm excited to continue building on this foundation\!
