# Code in Place 2025 Journey üöÄ

-----

Welcome to my repository for **Code in Place 2025**\! This repo serves as a comprehensive collection of my assignments and the final project completed during Stanford University's incredible Code in Place program.

## About Code in Place

Code in Place is a free, online introductory programming course offered by Stanford University, based on their popular CS106A course. It's designed to make computer science accessible to a global audience, providing a fantastic foundation in programming concepts using Python.

Being part of this program has been an amazing experience, fostering problem-solving skills, persistence, and a deep appreciation for the art of coding.

## Repository Contents

This repository is organized to reflect my progress throughout the course:

  * **`assignments/`**: This directory contains my solutions to the weekly assignments. Each subfolder corresponds to a specific assignment, showcasing my understanding of key concepts as they were introduced.

      * **Key topics covered in assignments include:**
          * **Karel the Robot:** Introduction to programming logic, functions, and control flow.
          * **Basic Python Concepts:** Variables, data types, operators, and input/output.
          * **Conditional Logic & Loops:** `if/else` statements, `for` loops, and `while` loops.
          * **Functions & Decomposition:** Writing reusable code and breaking down complex problems.
          * **Graphics & Animation:** Introduction to GUI programming and basic animation using the `graphics` library.
          * **Lists & Dictionaries:** Working with data structures.
          * And more\!

  * **`final_project/`**: This directory holds my culminating project for the course.

    ### My Final Project: Basketball Game üèÄ

    My final project is a **simple yet engaging Basketball Game** built using **Python** and the `graphics` library. It's an interactive application where users can control a basketball, shoot hoops, and score points.

    **Key features include:**

      * **Dynamic Ball Control:** The basketball follows the mouse cursor, allowing for intuitive aiming.
      * **Goal Detection:** Precise collision detection determines if the ball successfully enters the hoop.
      * **Interactive Feedback:** A "GOALLLLL" message flashes when a point is scored, adding to the game experience.
      * **Game Reset:** The ball automatically repositions after a score, ready for the next shot.

    Developing this game allowed me to solidify my understanding of **event handling, object manipulation, conditional logic, and animation**. It was incredibly rewarding to translate a game idea into functional code and see interactive elements come to life in a GUI application.

    *(Optional: Add a GIF or screenshot of your game here for visual appeal\!)*

## Technologies Used

  * **Python 3**
  * **`graphics.py` library** (provided by Stanford University for CS106A/Code in Place)

## How to Run the Projects (Locally)

To run any of the Python scripts or the final project locally, you'll need a Python environment set up.

1.  **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

    (Remember to replace `your-username/your-repo-name` with your actual GitHub path.)

2.  **Ensure `graphics.py` is available:** The `graphics.py` file should be in the same directory as the Python script you are trying to run, or in your Python's `site-packages` directory. It's usually provided as part of the course materials.

3.  **Run a specific assignment or the final project:**
    Navigate to the desired directory (e.g., `assignments/assignment_x/` or `final_project/`).

    ```bash
    cd final_project
    python your_project_file_name.py # e.g., python basketball_game.py
    ```

    For assignments, replace `your_project_file_name.py` with the relevant `.py` file for that assignment.

## Acknowledgements

A massive thank you to the entire **Code in Place team** at **Stanford University** for creating and delivering such an accessible, high-quality, and impactful programming course. The instructors, section leaders, and community made this a truly exceptional learning journey.

This experience has significantly boosted my confidence and opened my eyes to the vast possibilities that programming offers. I'm excited to continue building on this foundation\!
